```qazpad_vial.hex``` is the default .hex that comes pre-flashed on the PCB.

To build the firmware for yourself, the "qazpad" folder should be placed entirely in your QMK or Vial build environment's "keyboards" folder.

Make the firmware by running:

```make qazpad:default``` or ```make qazpad:vial``` in your build environment.
